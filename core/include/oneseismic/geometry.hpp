 * All the examples in this section will deal with the more natural 3

 * points/coordinates and the shape of volumes.

 * semantics. They are made distinct types so that mixing them up is a
 * violation, i.e. you cannot pass coordinates meant for fragments to a
 * function that expects to know the size of a cube.
 *
 * The names are made acronyms, with the following pattern:
 *    C - Cube
 *    F - Fragment
 *    P - Point
 *    S - Shape
 *    ND - Number-of-dimensions
 *
 * where
 *  - C refers to a full survey volume

 *  - P is a point/coordinate
 *  - S is the shape, shape of a C or F, and an upper bound of P
