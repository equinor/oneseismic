	// approx 20M responses.
	//

	// response concatenated 10 times indicates that there are no significant
	// size improvements, but huge runtime costs in upping the compression
	// level:
	//
	// $ time gzip -1 -c response.bin | wc -c

	// be the standard implementation for this.

/*
 * Centralize the understanding of error conditions of azblob.download.
 *
 * There are two classes of errors:
 * 1. A hard failure, i.e. the request itself failed, such as network
 *    conditions.
 * 2. A soft failure, i.e. the request itself suceeded, but was without
 *    sufficient permissions, wrong syntax or similar. azblob probably handles
 *    this by parsing the status code and maybe the response body.
 *
 * Most calls to FetchManifest() should probably immediately call this function
 * on error and exit, but it's moved into its own function so that error paths
 * can be emulated and tested independently. An added benefit is that should a
 * function, for some reason, need FetchManifest() but want custom error+abort
 * handling, it is sufficient to implement bespoke error handling and simply
 * not call this.
